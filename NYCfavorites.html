          While an unholy congolmeration that is the sum of as many dysfunctional parts as<br>
        New York City is necessarily brims with intriguing locales, I have defined and<br> 
        refined my own list of regular haunts. Having spent a large portion<br>
        of my life in New Orleans, I am well-qualified to declare when proper<br>
        food and drink are present. Listed here are those establishments of<br>
        New York which have earned an honored position within my regular<br> 
        rotation of outings.<br>
