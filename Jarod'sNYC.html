                An unholy and boisterous congolmeration that is the sum of as many dysfunctional parts as<br>
                New York City necessarily brims with intriguing locales. I have defined, and<br> 
                refined, my own list of regular haunts. Having spent a large portion<br>
                of my life in New Orleans, I am well-qualified to declare when proper<br>
                food and drink are present. Listed here are four of those establishments of<br>
                New York which have earned an honored position within my regular<br> 
                rotation of outings.<br>

                <font face = "franklin gothic" color = "silver" size = 6 </font> If I had to impress God himself with a drink, I would chose this stunning East Village former speakeasy,<br>
                     famous for its Japanese craft cocktails. No human language ever devised does it justice. <br>
                     Top shelf liquors, unique recipes, and stunning presentation.

                 storied hotel bar witnessed the first ever NYC production of <i> Hamlet </i> and has hosted presidents, kings, giants of industry,<br> 
                 legends of literature, and many others.<br>

                Route 66 on Stone Street in the Financial District hurtles past the minimum standards of excellence at warp speed.<br> 
                Choosing this spot for a last meal would not be a poor way in which to exit this wretched life.</center> <br>

                For the unititiated, this eatery specializes in a traditional Yunnan dish called 過橋米線 (Crossing the Bridge Noodles). Imagine the best udon, ramen, and pho you've ever
                masticated and then imagine it twice as delectable. Fresh meats and vegetables are carefully dropped into a broth of your choice which is brought to you at a rolling boil. 
                Dating from the Qing Dynasty, the legend behind this little known yet incomparable culinary experience is that in ancient Yunnan province a loving wife concocted the dish as a strategy to keep her 
                husband's food warm during his long walk across a bridge to his workshop....hence "Crossing the Bridge Noodles." Below is a video of this dish being prepared.</center> <br>
